# Quick Analysis Command

A quick way to activate sequential thinking for immediate problem analysis.

## Usage

```
/analyze [topic or problem]
```

## What It Does

This is a streamlined version of `/think` that:
- Activates sequential-thinking skill
- Focuses on rapid systematic analysis
- Provides structured breakdown of the problem
- Uses efficient thinking steps

## Examples

```
/analyze performance bottleneck in user authentication flow
```

```
/analyze pros and cons of using TypeScript vs JavaScript for this project
```

```
/analyze why tests are failing after recent refactoring
```

## When to Use

- Quick problem breakdown needed
- Rapid decision support
- Immediate systematic analysis
- When you need structure but not deep exploration

**Tip**: For more complex problems requiring branching and revision, use `/think` instead.
